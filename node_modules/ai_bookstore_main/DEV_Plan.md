2. **Intent Classification and Entity Recognition**
   - **Task**: Train AI models to classify user intents and recognize entities.
   - **Tools**: TensorFlow, PyTorch.
   - **Description**: Use labeled datasets to train models that understand user inputs and extract relevant information.

3. **Integration with Backend Services**
   - **Task**: Connect the AI bot with backend APIs for data retrieval and processing.
   - **Tools**: RESTful APIs, WebSockets.
   - **Description**: Ensure the AI bot can fetch and update data in real-time by interacting with backend services.

4. **Personalized Recommendations**
   - **Task**: Implement a recommendation system to provide personalized book suggestions.
   - **Tools**: Machine learning algorithms (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering).
   - **Description**: Analyze user data to offer tailored book recommendations.

5. **Dynamic Pricing and Promotions**
   - **Task**: Develop a dynamic pricing engine and promotion management system.
   - **Tools**: Machine learning models.
   - **Description**: Adjust prices and manage promotions based on demand, user behavior, and market trends.

6. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - **Task**: Implement NLP models to understand and process natural language queries.
   - **Tools**: Pre-trained NLP models (BERT, GPT).
   - **Description**: Enhance the AI botâ€™s ability to understand complex queries and respond appropriately.

7. **Complaint Management**
   - **Task**: Create a system for handling and resolving user and seller complaints.
   - **Tools**: AI-based categorization and tracking.
   - **Description**: Allow users and sellers to submit complaints, automatically categorize them, and track their resolution status.

#### 2. Backend Development

**Objective**: Develop a robust backend system to handle data storage, business logic, and communication between the frontend and AI components.

**Steps**:

1. **Project Setup**
   - **Task**: Set up the initial project structure using Node.js with Express or Django.
   - **Tools**: Node.js, Express, or Django.
   - **Description**: Initialize the project, set up necessary middleware, and configure basic routes.

2. **Database Setup**
   - **Task**: Configure MongoDB and Redis for data storage and caching.
   - **Tools**: Mongoose for MongoDB, Redis.
   - **Description**: Set up database schemas and models for users, books, orders, and transactions.

3. **API Development**
   - **Task**: Develop RESTful or GraphQL API endpoints for user and seller interactions.
   - **Tools**: Express or Django REST framework, GraphQL.
   - **Description**: Implement CRUD operations for users, books, orders, and handle authentication and authorization.

4. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - **Task**: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - **Tools**: OAuth2, JWT.
   - **Description**: Ensure secure login for sellers and token-based access control for API endpoints.

5. **Real-time Communication**
   - **Task**: Set up WebSockets for real-time updates.
   - **Tools**: Socket.io for Node.js or Django Channels.
   - **Description**: Enable real-time communication for order status updates and chat support.

6. **Payment Integration**
   - **Task**: Integrate payment gateways for handling transactions.
   - **Tools**: Stripe, PayPal APIs.
   - **Description**: Securely process payments and handle payment-related data.

7. **AI Bot Integration**
   - **Task**: Integrate AI bot with backend logic.
   - **Tools**: Rasa or Dialogflow.
   - **Description**: Handle requests from the AI bot, process natural language queries, and interact with the database.

8. **Shipment Management**
   - **Task**: Develop shipment management features.
   - **Tools**: API integrations with shipment services.
   - **Description**: Track shipments, update shipment status, and notify users.

9. **Dynamic Pricing and Marketing**
   - **Task**: Implement dynamic pricing and AI-driven marketing features.
   - **Tools**: Machine learning models, marketing APIs.
   - **Description**: Adjust book prices based on demand, generate marketing suggestions, and automate campaigns.

10. **Complaint Management**
    - **Task**: Develop backend logic for complaint management.
    - **Tools**: Express or Django, MongoDB.
    - **Description**: Handle complaints from users and sellers, categorize them, and track their resolution.

### Logic Models and Strategies

1. **User Authentication Logic**
   - **Description**: Implement OAuth2 for seller login and JWT for user sessions. Ensure that tokens are securely stored and managed.

2. **Book Genre Assignment using NLP**
   - **Description**: Train NLP models to analyze book descriptions and assign appropriate genres. Use pre-trained models from TensorFlow or PyTorch for efficiency.

3. **Personalized Recommendation System**
   - **Description**: Use collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to recommend books. Integrate machine learning models that analyze user behavior and preferences.
